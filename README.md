# dice
A simple dice game I made as one of my first vanilla javascript projects. The first player to 20 points wins the game. On each turn you have the option of getting double points or losing all your points by hitting the double or nothing button. You can play the game here https://codepen.io/kynnedye/pen/MWoQZyB
